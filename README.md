# Understanding Controlled Input

First let us clone and run this project: \

Open your command prompt or bash and enter: \

`git clone https://github.com/frankoadeleye/controlled-uncontrolled-with-hooks.git` \

Enter the folder with: \

`cd controlled-uncontrolled-with-hooks` \

Install dependencies with: \

`yarn`

Run your project with: \

`yarn start`

## The problem: 

Check your browser for result and enter your 'first name' and 'last name' respectively. Then click 'create card'. \

Now return to the input fields and try to change the values of the fields. You'd notice that the result in the card is also updated in real-time. This is because we have an unchange handler that actives updates the state and prints the result simultaneously. This is the default state of React and how it is created to work. Such inputs are called `controlled inputs`. \

Now, say we don't the update in the browser to be instant but we only want the update in the card to be after we click the button. How do we go about this? 

We can solve this two ways: 

[The first way: using a second state ](https://github.com/frankoadeleye/controlled-uncontrolled-with-hooks/solved-controlled-inputs). 


[The second (better) way: useRef](https://github.com/frankoadeleye/controlled-uncontrolled-with-hooks).





























This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
